## Install

- **NPM:** `$ npm install --save multi-select-dropdown`

- [**Download**](https://github.com/bsara/multi-select-dropdown.js/releases)



## Features

- Built with fully native, pure JavaScript! No extra libraries needed.
- Uses native HTML5 `select` and `option` elements. (I.E. It won't mess up your existing styles and won't create a million new elements that you don't expect to be present on a page).
- Uses overridable CSS for all needed style manipulations. (I.E. No manipulation of `style` attribute on HTML tags!)
- Nearly everything is done for you! Just set the correct data attributes, and you're done!
- "Select All Options" feature built in, no extra work needed.
- SCSS library provided for easier style overrides.
- Simple manager provided in case you just want to initialize for all desired elements on a page, rather than initializing support one by one.
- Super lightweight.
- Very easy to use.
- Support for...
    - AMD
    - CommonJS
    - Global HTML script tag
